# Tic Tac Toe iOS (SwiftUI) — Scaffold

This is a minimal SwiftUI app scaffold for a Tic Tac Toe iOS app.

## What’s included
- SwiftUI app entry point
- Basic Tic Tac Toe UI (3x3 grid), turn handling, win/draw detection
- Reset button
- Simple MVVM-ish `GameViewModel`

## Build / Run
Open `TicTacToeIOS.xcodeproj` in Xcode and run.

> Note: This scaffold is written to be Xcode-friendly. In CI/preview environments without Xcode, compilation may not be possible, but the project structure is standard.

## Project structure
- `TicTacToeIOS/` — App sources and assets
- `TicTacToeIOS.xcodeproj/` — Xcode project
- `TicTacToeIOSTests/` and `TicTacToeIOSUITests/` — minimal test targets
